\subsection{Basic Experiment}

In the basic experiment, I used experimented two models on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset.

For both models, I used the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Batch size: 8
    \item Epochs: 100
    \item Optimizer: Adam
    \item Learning rate: $1 \times 10^{-4}$
    \item Scheduler: None
\end{itemize}


The training and validation dice score for both models are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:train_val_dice_basic}.
And the loss curve for both models are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:train_val_loss_basic}.
We can see that both models have similar performance on the validation set, which has dice score higher than 0.9 on the validation set.
The training dice score is higher than the validation dice score, which is expected.
The training loss is lower than the validation loss, which is also expected.
Note that the loss is described at subsection~\ref{sec:loss_function}.
Please refer there for more details.
