\subsection{Basic Experiment}

In the basic experiment, I used experimented two models on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset.

For both models, I used the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Batch size: 32
    \item Epochs: 200
    \item Optimizer: Adam
    \item Learning rate: $1 \times 10^{-4}$
    \item Scheduler: None
\end{itemize}

The experiment shows that both model can achieve a high accuracy on training set, validation set and test set. (More than 90\% accuracy)
