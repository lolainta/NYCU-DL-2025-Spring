\subsection{Double Convolution Without Batch Normalization}

Since the UNet model I implemented use the double convolution block with batch normalization that Olaf Ronneberger et al.~\cite{UNet} didn't use, I decided to implement the double convolution block without batch normalization to see how it affects the performance of the model.

The result of the model with double convolution block without batch normalization is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:train_val_dice_wo_bn} and Figure~\ref{fig:train_val_loss_wo_bn}.
