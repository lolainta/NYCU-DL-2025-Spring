\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this lab we build a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model that turns a set of color-shape phrases (e.g., ``red sphere'', ``yellow cube'') into a 64 $\times$ 64 scene containing exactly the requested objects.
We will use a pretrained ResNet-18 model to evaluate the accuracy of the generated images.

We will use the \texttt{CLEVR} dataset, which contains 3D shapes and their corresponding color-shape phrases. The dataset is available \href{https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen}{here}.
