\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this report, we will discuss the implementation of Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and its variants, including Double DQN~\cite{vanhasselt2016deep}, Prioritized Experience Replay~\cite{schaul2016prioritized}, and Multi-Step Learning~\cite{daley2024averaging}.
We will also analyze the performance of these algorithms on both the \cartpole and \pong environments.
The goal is to understand the impact of these techniques on the learning process and the final performance of the agent.
